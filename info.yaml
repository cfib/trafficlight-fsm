# TinyTapeout project information
#
# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# This will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "Traffic Light FSM"
  description:  "FSM controlling two (red-yellow-green) traffic lights"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "State machine that implements a typical Austrian traffic light: Red -> Red+Yellow -> Green -> Green Blinking -> Yellow -> Red. Generated using a hacked-together Verilog->Wokwi flow :D."      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "Starts in 'error' mode (yellow blinking). Switch SW1 (reset) to 1 and back to 0 to start operation. 'error' mode can be reached by toggling SW2."      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  "2 red LEDs, 2 yellow LEDs, 2 green LEDs and current limiting resistors"      # Describe any external hardware needed
  doc_link:     ""      # URL to longer form documentation, eg the README.md in your repository
  clock_hz:     2       # Clock frequency in Hz (if required)
  language:     "wokwi" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  wokwi_id:     341410909669818963       # the wokwi ID
